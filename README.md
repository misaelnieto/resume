# This is Noe Nieto's Resum√©

This site was made with Jekyll using the [modern-resume-theme](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme).

This repo has github actions to deploy this repo automatically to my site. I
used [lemonarc/jekyll-action](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action) to build
the site and [Pendect/action-rsyncer](https://github.com/Pendect/action-rsyncer)
to upload the changes to the server.
