  sub_title: SRAX Web Developer

    Short description of the company (optional)
  description: |
    Working on SR was both fun a challenging. When I started, the company’s Ad
    exchange backend was the typical LAMP stack with a lot of legacy code on
    stored procedures and PHP/CodeIgniter code. Deployment process was
    completely manual and error prone.

    My first assignment was to streamline their somehow complex onboarding
    process, I wrote the backend using stored procedures and tested them using
    PHPUnit and a MySQL server running on a ramdisk.

    Their Real Time Bidding system relied on a proprietary algorithm written in
    C++. The developer had never worked on Linux before, so I helped him by
    configuring a proper sandbox server and wrote a tool that would pull the
    latest changes from SVN/Git, compile the code and restart the web server
    with a webhook or with the click of a button.

    At the end of my time on SR/SRAX the new onboarding process was finished, we
    had already integrated several ad exchanges into our backend (a huge
    milestone), the team migrated from SVN to Git, we started to write tests
    with PHPUnit and Selenium and the developer’s development enviroment was now
    semi automated using a customized version of Puphpet, (code named Arale) and
    the whole team was already using Agile methodologies. Besides the developer
    role, I also enjoyed administering some of Linux servers with Puppet and
    staring to New Relics graphs.

    **Technologies used:** PHP/CodeIgniter, LAMP, Linux, C++, Jira, NewRelic

    Short description of the company (optional)
  description: |
    This was mi first time working on a data center of a company. My main
    responsibilities included administration, maintenance, backup and
    optimization and emergency response for SQL Server databases, IIS, and Linux
    hosts for ftp/sftp, web and backup systems, all integrated into the
    company’s Active Directory server. I was in charge of monitoring all the
    changes pushed by the developers; Our Database load had high concurrency and
    I had to look for naive queries that otherwise would trash the DB server.
    Also since database sizes typically exceeded Terabytes, we had to be a bit
    extra careful for backups. Some of the SQL Servers had HA configurations
    like replicas and Always On. Also, I had the chance to work on internal
    tools using ASP .NET MVC., AWS S3, VMWare, Python and RabbitMQ.

    **Technologies used**: SQL Server, IIS, Linux, Active Directory, IIS,
    Apache, MS Access, SSIS, Red Gate’s SQL Compare, SQL Backup and SQL Monitor,
    Redmine, DB Comparer, Heidi SQL.

    Short description of the company (optional)
  description: |
    At the beginning our stack was Linux (on AWS), Nginx, HTML, CSS and vanilla
    JavaScript with some jQuery on the frontend, Python and Grok on the backend
    (using ZODB, a NoSQL) until the JS code became difficult to maintain; to
    escape our doom we migrated to another stack: Python, Pyramid and SQL
    Alchemy with a good JSON API on the backend, and Angular.js 1.x on the
    frontend. Additionally, I managed the Linux servers on AWS.

    **Technologies used**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Pyramid, Linux,
    Angular.js, Git, subversion.
