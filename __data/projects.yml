    We started around March 2010 with a Plone 4.x site, which included a custom
    theme with some custom content types using Dexterity and
    Products.PloneGetPaid, which was still alive then. After several
    shortcommings with Plone, we migrated to Django and DjangoLFS and I created
    some plugins to make it usable for selling digital downloads. But DjangoLFS
    is showing its age and we are already working on migrating the site to
    Woocommerce.
