    DEVSIM is a TCAD (Technology Computer Aided Design) semiconductor device
    simulation software. TCAD tools are special simulation software that can
    simulate the fabrication process of semiconductors as well as their
    operation. The objective of this work was to add the necessary improvements
    to DEVSIM so it can simulate solar cells.

    Thesis title: _ESTUDIO POR SIMULACIÓN DE LOS EFECTOS DE DISEÑO EN CELDAS
    SOLARES SEMICONDUCTORAS_. I used Silvaco's TCAD software simulate the
    fabrication solar cells using Crystaline Silicon as substrate with Boron and
    Phosphorus as dopants using diffusion or ion implantation. Besides earning
    my degree, I used this knowledge to work on 2018 edition of Google's Summer
    of Code with the project "[Enable DEVSIM to simulate solar
    cells](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6310236080046080/)"

    Three day intensive course for the role of SCRUM Master. After training I
    passed the accreditation exam on May 29. My Authorized Certification ID is
    `79778815187513`. The Certificate validity period is lifetime. You can use
    the [ISI's website to verify the
    certificate](https://www.scrum-institute.org/International_Scrum_Institute_Certificate_Validation_Tool.php).

    My Thesis *"Sistema de Vigilancia con video sobre TCP/IP"* demostrates the
    possibility of building surveillance systems by using only Free/Libre/Open
    Source Software (i.e Linux, Python, Supervisord and Gstreamer). I also
    installed a 8-node cluster in the parallel computing research laboratory of
    the Instituto Tecnologico de Puebla as social service using Linux, and the
    MPI/BLAS/Lapack stack.
