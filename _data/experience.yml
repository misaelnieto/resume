    hosts for ftp/sftp, web and backup systems, all integrated into the
    company's Active Directory server. I was in charge of monitoring all the
    changes pushed by the developers; Our Database load had high concurrency and
    I had to look for naive queries that otherwise would trash the DB server.
    Also since database sizes typically exceeded Terabytes, we had to be a bit
    extra careful for backups. Also, I had the chance to work on a couple
    projects using ASP .NET.

    Our stack was Linux (on AWS), Nginx, HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript with

    NoSQL) until the JS code became difficult to mantain; to escape our doom we migrated to another stack: Python, Pyramid
    and SQLAlchemy with a good JSON API on the backend, and AngularJS 1.x on the
    frontend. Additionally, I managed the Linux servers on AWS.
