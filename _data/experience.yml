  dates: November 2015 - August 2017
  job_title: SRAX Web Developer
  description: |
    Around that time, the company's Ad exchange backend was the typical LAMP
    stack with a lot of legacy code on stored procedures and PHP/<mark>CodeIgniter</mark>
    code. <mark>Bootstrap</mark> and vanilla JS were used on the frontend. At the end of my time on Social Reality we had integrated several ad exchanges into our backend (a big change)
    Besides the
    developer role, I also enjoyed administering the Linux servers. We used
    <mark>Puppet</mark> to manage the systems configuration.

- company: Valutech Outsourcing S.A. de C.V. (now Clover Wireless)
  dates: October 2013 - November 2015
  job_title: Android Development
  description: |
    My main responsibilities included administration, maintenance, backup and
    optimization and emergency response for <mark>SQL Server</mark> databases,
    <mark>IIS</mark>, and Linux hosts for ftp, web and backup systems, all
    integrated into the company's <mark>Active Directory</mark> server. I had a
    very good time working for Valutech's IT team because they managed their own
    data center; we had the chance to tinker around diferent virtualization
    strategies like <mark>VMWare</mark>, <mark>Azure</mark>, Amazon Web Services
    like <mark>EBS</mark>, <mark>EC2</mark> and <mark>S3</mark>, and
    <mark>VirtualBox</mark> for local testing. The main database server
    required High Availability configurations, but beside the high concurrency
    load, we also had to be really watchful for all the developers ensuring they
    don't run naive queries that otherwise would trash the DB server. Also
    since database sizes typically exceeded Terabytes, we had to be a bit extra
    careful for backups.

  dates: August 2011 - March 2014
  job_title: Full stack developer
  description: |
    Our stack was Linux (on <mark>AWS</mark>), <mark>Nginx</mark>, <mark>HTML</mark>, <mark>CSS</mark> and vanilla <mark>Javascript</mark> with
    some <mark>jQuery</mark> on the frontend, <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Grok</mark> on the backend (using <mark>ZODB</mark>,
    NoSQL database before it was mainstream). This stack meant a lot of fun until the
    JS code became a nightmare to mantain; to escape our doom we migrated to
    another stack: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Pyramid</mark> and <mark>SQLAlchemy</mark> with a good JSON API on the
    backend, and <mark>AngularJS</mark> on the frontend. It was beautiful until <mark>AngularJs</mark>
    guys decided to rewrite it and with that they broke my code and my heart, so I haven't touched AngularJS since then.
    Oh, additionally, I managed the <mark>Linux</mark> servers on <mark>AWS</mark>.
