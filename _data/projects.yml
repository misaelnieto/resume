    This is my main personal project. I work on it on my free time. We started
    around March 2010 with a Plone 4.x site, which included a custom theme with
    some custom content types using <mark>Dexterity</mark> and
    Products.PloneGetPaid, which was still alive then. After several
    shortcommings with Plone, we migrated to Django and DjangoLFS and created
    some plugins to make it work for us. Now DjangoLFS is showing its age and we
    are already working on migrating the site from django to Woocommerce.

    Every now and then I want to test some library or concept or I just need a
    small tool to scratch my itch. This is where I upload them. Feel free to
    walk around.
